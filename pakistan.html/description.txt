<h3>
<p>Istor-o-Nal is the third highest mountain in the Hindu Kush, in the Chitral District of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan.
 It is the 68th highest independent peak in the world. It is 7,000 m (22,966 ft) tall in height. 
 Because Istor-o-Nal is behind the higher peak of Tirich Mir from many viewpoints, it is not easily visible and therefore not well known.</p>
